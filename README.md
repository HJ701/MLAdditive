# ML-Driven Additive Selection for Polyolefins

This project develops a machine learning system to recommend optimal additive formulations for polyethylene and polypropylene grades, enhancing their lifetime performance under specific environmental conditions.

## üîç Objective

To intelligently predict the **ideal combination and dosage** of additives (e.g., antioxidants, carbon black, waxes) based on resin type and environmental exposure, using ML regression models.

## üß© Project Components

### 1. Dataset Development
- **Synthetic and empirical data** simulation covering:
  - Base resin: Polyethylene / Polypropylene
  - Additives: Primary & Secondary AO, Carbon Black, Waxes, etc.
  - Environment: Temp, UV, ClO‚ÇÇ, Water, Pressure
  - Output: Predicted Lifetime

### 2. Model Development
- ML regression pipeline:
  - Feature preprocessing & encoding
  - Lifetime prediction using regression models (e.g., XGBoost, MLP, etc.)
  - Evaluation: R¬≤, MAE, visual plots

### 3. Degradation Logic (Optional)
- Surrogate models or analytical equations (literature-informed)

### 4. GUI Interface (Optional)
- A simple interface to input resin type & environment, and output optimal additive formulation
